A cozy mobile game where you play as a librarian cat.

ads notes:

TW - target Birmingham.
Cheaper: Facebook, instagram - usually doesn't drive sales well
More expensive: Google drives sales: $5/day adspend to get started
Performance Max - built on user data, audiences:

- give it types of people and it will give you more
- give it pieces and it will mix/match them
- run as display, youtube, email, search
- tends to drive cost down

Cute creative for social ads - targeted to small business painpoints - super low burn in area: $1/day per target

Game
$200 per month - $100 per labor / scales right up at this ratio, mostly
Nationwide - $10,000 month on ads (hypothetical) - $1000 for labor
